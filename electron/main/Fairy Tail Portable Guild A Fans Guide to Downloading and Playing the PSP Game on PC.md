You can find the ISO file of Fairy Tail Portable Guild on various websites that offer PSP games for download, such as [https://romsmania.cc/](https://romsmania.cc/). However, be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they might contain viruses or malware. Also, make sure that you own a legal copy of the game before downloading it.
  
Once you have the ISO file of Fairy Tail Portable Guild on your PC, you can launch PPSSPP and load the game from the file menu. You can then configure the settings of the emulator according to your preferences, such as graphics, sound, controls, and performance. You can also customize the keyboard or use a controller to play the game. You can find more information about how to use PPSSPP on its official website or on online forums.
  
With PPSSPP, you can enjoy playing Fairy Tail Portable Guild on your PC with high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay. You can also save and load your progress anytime you want. However, keep in mind that some features of the game might not work properly on an emulator, such as multiplayer mode or online connectivity. Also, some glitches or bugs might occur during gameplay. If you encounter any problems with PPSSPP or Fairy Tail Portable Guild, you can try updating the emulator or changing its settings.
  
Fairy Tail Portable Guild is a fun and exciting game for fans of Fairy Tail who want to experience the magic and adventure of the series on their own. By using PPSSPP, you can play it on your PC without having to buy a PSP or a game disc.
