# Assassin's Creed Syndicate 2 DLC-FTS Corepack: A Review

Assassin's Creed Syndicate is one of the most popular games in the franchise, set in Victorian London during the Industrial Revolution. It features two playable characters, Jacob and Evie Frye, who lead a gang of rebels against the Templars. The game also has two DLCs: Jack the Ripper, which explores the infamous serial killer's connection to the Assassins; and The Last Maharaja, which follows Duleep Singh's struggle to reclaim his birthright as the Maharaja of Punjab.

However, downloading and installing the game with all the DLCs can be quite time-consuming and space-consuming. The original CODEX release is 57.4 GB in size, while the FTS corepack is only 19.4 GB. But what is a corepack and how does it work? Is it safe and reliable? And most importantly, does it affect the gameplay quality? In this review, we'll answer these questions and help you decide if the FTS corepack is worth downloading.

## What is a corepack?

A corepack is a type of repack that compresses a game's files without removing or modifying anything. It uses advanced algorithms and techniques to reduce the size of the game without affecting its performance or quality. A corepack is different from a rip, which removes some files or features from the game to make it smaller.

The FTS corepack for Assassin's Creed Syndicate is based on the CODEX release, which includes all the updates and DLCs. It also includes alternative cracks from 3DM, ALI213, and RELOADED, as well as bonus unlockers. The corepack claims to be 100% lossless and MD5 perfect, meaning that all files are identical to originals after installation.
